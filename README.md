# Stock Analysis Tools and Libraries in python

This is my notes on the python tools and libraries available for stocks analysis in Nov 2020.

## Data Sources


### yfinance

This library allows for pythonic download of Yahoo Finance data.
https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/

Yahoo Finance has not just pricing data, but also other information such as earnings, cashflow, etc.  Refer to the Quick Start session from the page above for details.



### Quandl

Got this from the stocker analysis by Will Koehrsen.  It is an aggregated dataset and offers not just stocks data but also things like US GDP, WTI Crude data price, etc.

So, in order to get the data you want, you will need to know the 'Quandl Code' for the data.

## Analysis and Modelling

### fbprophet

Prophet is a time series analysis library by Facebook.  Seems to be quite sophisticated; also takes time to install since it requires a gcc compiler.
